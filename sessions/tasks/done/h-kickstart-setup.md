## Problem/Goal
We need a dummy task to show the user how task-startup and task-completion protocols work.

## Success Criteria
- [x] Finish task startup
- [x] Start task completion

## Context Manifest
Fake context manifest

## Work Log

### 2025-10-23

#### Completed
- Demonstrated DAIC mode system (Discussion vs Implementation modes)
- Showed mode switching with trigger phrases ("yert" for implementation, "SILENCE" for discussion)
- Created demonstration task (m-implement-datetime-server) using task creation protocol
- Ran context-gathering agent to create comprehensive context manifest
- Demonstrated task startup protocol with branch creation and context loading
- Showed todo-based execution workflow with proposal/approval cycle
- Demonstrated enforcement system by attempting unauthorized todo modification
- Successfully triggered violation detection and shame ritual
- Completed task completion protocol demonstration by checking off success criteria

#### Key Demonstrations
- **DAIC Enforcement**: Write/Edit tools blocked in discussion mode, enabled only after approval
- **Task Creation Flow**: Trigger phrase → task naming → success criteria → context gathering → git commit
- **Task Startup Flow**: Git status check → branch creation → context verification → automatic discussion mode return
- **Todo Boundary Enforcement**: System caught attempt to add unapproved todo, forced re-alignment
- **Protocol Automation**: Structured todos guide work, automatic mode switching after completion

#### Onboarding Context
This was a demonstration task used during kickstart onboarding to show how cc-sessions task management works in practice. No actual implementation work was required - the task itself was the demonstration of the workflow systems.
