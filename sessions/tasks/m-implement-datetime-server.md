# Python DateTime Server

## Problem/Goal
Create a Python HTTP server that serves an HTML page displaying the current date and time on port 8456.

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Python server runs on port 8456
- [ ] HTML page displays current date and time
- [ ] Page updates to show current time (auto-refresh or manual refresh)

## Context Manifest
<!-- Added by context-gathering agent -->

### Current Repository State: Clean Slate for Python Application

This is a **brand new repository** with no existing Python code, dependencies, or project structure. The repository currently contains only the cc-sessions task management system infrastructure. This means we have complete freedom to implement this HTTP server task from scratch without worrying about existing patterns, dependencies, or architectural constraints.

**Key Repository Facts:**
- No Python files exist yet in the project root
- No dependency management files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, Pipfile, poetry.lock)
- No external Python packages installed beyond standard library
- Python 3.11.2 is available in the environment
- Port 8456 is available and not currently in use
- Git repository is initialized with main branch
- Project follows cc-sessions workflow with DAIC mode system (Discussion-Alignment-Implementation-Check)

**Repository Structure:**

├── README.md             # Project readme
└── .gitignore           # Git ignore patterns
```

**What This Means for Implementation:**
We will be creating the FIRST Python file in this repository. This gives us the responsibility to establish good patterns that future Python code might follow. The implementation should be:
- Self-contained and simple (no unnecessary dependencies)
- Well-structured for potential future expansion
- Properly placed in the repository root or a sensible subdirectory
- Documented for future developers

### How Python HTTP Servers Work: Standard Library Approach

Since no external frameworks like Flask or FastAPI are installed, and this is a simple requirement, we should use Python's **built-in http.server module** from the standard library. This is the appropriate tool for this task because:

1. **No dependencies required** - Part of Python standard library
2. **Simple to implement** - Minimal boilerplate for basic HTTP serving
3. **Perfect for single-page applications** - Our requirement is just one HTML page
4. **Educational value** - Shows fundamental HTTP request/response handling

**How http.server Module Works:**

The `http.server` module provides two main approaches:

**Approach 1: Custom Request Handler (RECOMMENDED for this task)**

When you create a custom HTTP server in Python using the standard library, you build on top of `http.server.BaseHTTPRequestHandler`. Here's how the request handling flow works:

1. **Server Initialization:** You create an HTTPServer instance bound to a specific host and port (in our case, localhost:8456)

2. **Request Handler Class:** You define a class inheriting from `BaseHTTPRequestHandler` that defines how to handle different HTTP methods

3. **Request Processing Flow:**
   - Client makes HTTP request to http://localhost:8456
   - HTTPServer accepts the connection
   - Creates an instance of your custom RequestHandler class
   - Calls the appropriate method based on HTTP verb (do_GET, do_POST, etc.)
   - Your handler method is responsible for:
     - Sending response status code (200 OK, 404 Not Found, etc.)
     - Sending response headers (Content-Type, Content-Length, etc.)
     - Sending the actual response body (HTML content)

4. **Response Construction:**
   ```python
   # Step 1: Send status line
   self.send_response(200)  # HTTP/1.1 200 OK

   # Step 2: Send headers
   self.send_header('Content-Type', 'text/html; charset=utf-8')
   self.send_header('Content-Length', len(html_content))
   self.end_headers()  # Blank line separating headers from body

   # Step 3: Send body
   self.wfile.write(html_content.encode('utf-8'))
   ```

5. **Server Lifecycle:**
   - `server.serve_forever()` runs an infinite loop accepting connections
   - Each request is handled synchronously (one at a time)
   - Server continues until interrupted (Ctrl+C or kill signal)
   - Cleanup happens in exception handler or signal handler

**Approach 2: Simple File Server (NOT suitable for this task)**

You can run `python3 -m http.server 8456` to serve static files from a directory, but this doesn't meet our requirements because:
- We need to dynamically generate HTML with current date/time
- We need to inject current server time into the response
- We can't serve a static HTML file because the time would never update

**Why Custom Handler is Required:**

Our success criteria states "Page updates to show current time (auto-refresh or manual refresh)". This means:
- On each page load, the server must generate HTML with the **current** date and time
- The time value comes from `datetime.datetime.now()` called during request handling
- This requires code execution on every request, not static file serving

### What Needs to Be Built: Implementation Requirements

**Primary Deliverable: datetime_server.py**

A Python script that:
1. Imports necessary modules: `http.server`, `datetime`, and `socketserver` (optionally)
2. Defines a custom request handler class inheriting from `BaseHTTPRequestHandler`
3. Implements the `do_GET` method to handle HTTP GET requests
4. Generates dynamic HTML content on each request containing current date/time
5. Properly sends HTTP response headers (status 200, Content-Type: text/html)
6. Binds the server to port 8456 on localhost
7. Starts the server with `serve_forever()` in a try/except block for clean shutdown

**HTML Generation Requirements:**

The HTML should be generated dynamically inside the `do_GET` method:
```python
def do_GET(self):
    # Get current datetime
    now = datetime.datetime.now()

    # Format it for display (multiple format options available)
    formatted_time = now.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')  # Example: 2025-10-23 14:30:45
    # Or: now.strftime('%B %d, %Y at %I:%M:%S %p')     # Example: October 23, 2025 at 02:30:45 PM

    # Generate HTML with embedded time
    html_content = f"""
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>Current Date and Time</title>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <!-- Optional: Auto-refresh every N seconds -->
        <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="5">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Current Server Time</h1>
        <p>{formatted_time}</p>
    </body>
    </html>
    """

    # Send response...
```

**Auto-Refresh Implementation Options:**

The success criteria mentions "auto-refresh or manual refresh". Two approaches:

1. **HTML Meta Refresh (Simplest):** Add `<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="5">` to refresh every 5 seconds
   - Pros: No JavaScript needed, works everywhere, simple to implement
   - Cons: Full page reload, visible flash, not smooth

2. **JavaScript-based Update (More sophisticated):**
   - Fetch API or XMLHttpRequest to get new time without page reload
   - Requires server to return just time data (JSON endpoint) or full HTML
   - Updates DOM element without full page reload
   - Smoother user experience but more complex

For initial implementation, **HTML meta refresh is recommended** as it's simpler and fully meets requirements.

**Error Handling Considerations:**

The server should handle:
1. **Keyboard Interrupt (Ctrl+C):** Graceful shutdown when user stops the server
   ```python
   try:
       server.serve_forever()
   except KeyboardInterrupt:
       print("\nServer stopped by user")
       server.shutdown()
   ```

2. **Port Already in Use:** If port 8456 is occupied, the server will raise `OSError: [Errno 98] Address already in use`
   - Currently port 8456 is available
   - Could add error message suggesting alternative port

3. **Permission Issues:** Ports below 1024 require root privileges, but 8456 is safe

4. **Request Errors:** BaseHTTPRequestHandler has built-in error handling for malformed requests

**Logging and Output:**

BaseHTTPRequestHandler automatically logs each request to stdout in this format:
```
127.0.0.1 - - [23/Oct/2025 14:30:45] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

You should also add startup message:
```python
print(f"Server started on http://localhost:{PORT}")
print("Press Ctrl+C to stop")
```

### Technical Reference Details

#### Module Imports Required

```python
from http.server import HTTPServer, BaseHTTPRequestHandler
import datetime
# Optional: import socketserver for threading support
```

#### Request Handler Class Structure

```python
class DateTimeHandler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    """Custom HTTP request handler that serves current date/time"""

    def do_GET(self):
        """Handle HTTP GET requests"""
        # 1. Get current time
        # 2. Generate HTML
        # 3. Send response status
        # 4. Send headers
        # 5. Send body
        pass

    def log_message(self, format, *args):
        """Override to customize logging (optional)"""
        pass
```

#### Server Setup and Execution

```python
PORT = 8456
HOST = 'localhost'  # or '0.0.0.0' for all interfaces, or '127.0.0.1'

# Create server instance
server = HTTPServer((HOST, PORT), DateTimeHandler)

# Start server
try:
    print(f"Server running on http://{HOST}:{PORT}")
    server.serve_forever()
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("\nShutting down server...")
    server.shutdown()
```

#### datetime Module Usage

```python
import datetime

# Get current date and time
now = datetime.datetime.now()

# Common formatting options for display:
now.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')           # 2025-10-23 14:30:45
now.strftime('%B %d, %Y at %I:%M:%S %p')    # October 23, 2025 at 02:30:45 PM
now.strftime('%A, %B %d, %Y %H:%M:%S')      # Thursday, October 23, 2025 14:30:45
now.isoformat()                              # 2025-10-23T14:30:45.123456

# Access individual components:
now.year, now.month, now.day
now.hour, now.minute, now.second, now.microsecond
```

#### HTTP Response Structure

```python
# Status codes
self.send_response(200)  # OK
self.send_response(404)  # Not Found
self.send_response(500)  # Internal Server Error

# Common headers
self.send_header('Content-Type', 'text/html; charset=utf-8')
self.send_header('Content-Type', 'application/json')
self.send_header('Content-Length', len(content))
self.send_header('Cache-Control', 'no-cache')  # Prevent caching

# End headers (sends blank line)
self.end_headers()

# Write response body (must be bytes)
self.wfile.write(content.encode('utf-8'))
```

#### File Location Recommendations

**Option 1: Repository Root (RECOMMENDED for simplicity)**
```
/root/TESTCC/datetime_server.py
```
- Easiest to find and run
- Clear that it's a standalone script
- Run with: `python3 /root/TESTCC/datetime_server.py`

**Option 2: Source Directory (for future organization)**
```
/root/TESTCC/src/datetime_server.py
```
- Better if project grows to have multiple Python modules
- Establishes a pattern for future code
- Run with: `python3 /root/TESTCC/src/datetime_server.py`

**Option 3: Scripts Directory**
```
/root/TESTCC/scripts/datetime_server.py
```
- Good if this is a utility/tool rather than main application
- Run with: `python3 /root/TESTCC/scripts/datetime_server.py`

For this task, **Option 1 (repository root)** is recommended since:
- This is currently the only Python code
- It's a simple, self-contained server
- Future refactoring can move it if the project grows

#### Running the Server

```bash
# From project root
cd /root/TESTCC
python3 datetime_server.py

# Or with absolute path
python3 /root/TESTCC/datetime_server.py

# Test it works
curl http://localhost:8456
# Or visit in browser: http://localhost:8456
```

#### Testing Checklist

After implementation, verify:
1. Server starts without errors
2. Server binds to port 8456 (check with `netstat -tuln | grep 8456`)
3. HTTP request to http://localhost:8456 returns HTML
4. HTML displays current date and time
5. Refreshing page shows updated time
6. Time format is readable and user-friendly
7. Server logs requests to stdout
8. Ctrl+C cleanly stops the server
9. HTML is valid (has DOCTYPE, proper tags)
10. Content-Type header is set correctly

### Alternative Implementation Approaches (Not Recommended for This Task)

For completeness, here are other ways to implement HTTP servers in Python, and why they're not ideal for this simple task:

**Flask Framework:**
```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return f"<h1>{datetime.datetime.now()}</h1>"

app.run(port=8456)
```
- Requires installation: `pip install flask`
- Overkill for a single-route server
- Adds dependency to a dependency-free project

**FastAPI Framework:**
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"time": str(datetime.datetime.now())}
```
- Requires installation: `pip install fastapi uvicorn`
- More focused on APIs than HTML serving
- Returns JSON by default (would need HTMLResponse)
- Even more overkill than Flask

**socketserver with Custom TCP Handler:**
- Lower level than needed
- Would have to manually construct HTTP responses
- More complex than http.server
- No benefit for this use case

**Conclusion:** Python's built-in `http.server` module is the perfect tool for this job. It requires zero dependencies, is part of the standard library, and is designed exactly for this type of simple HTTP serving task.

### Security and Best Practices Notes

**Binding Address:**
- `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`: Only accessible from local machine (RECOMMENDED for development)
- `0.0.0.0`: Accessible from any network interface (use with caution)

**Port Choice:**
- Port 8456 is in the "user/ephemeral" range (1024-49151)
- No special privileges required
- Not a standard port, so unlikely to conflict

**Production Considerations (out of scope for this task):**
- This server is NOT production-ready
- No HTTPS/TLS support
- No authentication/authorization
- Single-threaded (one request at a time)
- For production, use proper WSGI server (gunicorn, uwsgi) with nginx/apache

**Code Quality:**
- Add docstrings to class and methods
- Use descriptive variable names
- Include comments for non-obvious parts
- Follow PEP 8 style guide (4 spaces, line length, etc.)

### Success Criteria Interpretation

Let's break down exactly what each criterion means:

**"Python server runs on port 8456"**
- ✓ Server successfully binds to port 8456
- ✓ No errors on startup
- ✓ Can accept incoming HTTP connections
- ✓ Verifiable with: `netstat -tuln | grep 8456` showing LISTEN state

**"HTML page displays current date and time"**
- ✓ Returns valid HTML document (DOCTYPE, html, head, body tags)
- ✓ HTML contains date and time information
- ✓ Date and time are human-readable (not epoch timestamps)
- ✓ Shows both date AND time components (not just one)
- ✓ Verifiable with: curl shows HTML, browser renders correctly

**"Page updates to show current time (auto-refresh or manual refresh)"**
- ✓ Manual refresh: New request shows updated time (different from previous)
- ✓ OR auto-refresh: Page automatically refreshes every few seconds
- ✓ Each request generates NEW current time (not cached)
- ✓ Time advances with real clock (proof server is generating dynamically)

**Implementation Note:** The most straightforward interpretation is:
- HTML meta tag with auto-refresh every 5 seconds satisfies "auto-refresh"
- This also works with manual refresh (browser refresh button)
- Both criteria satisfied with single approach
